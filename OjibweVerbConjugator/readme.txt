htmlmaker.py is the script which accepts command line arguments.
The first argument is the verb type, which may be vta, vti, vti2, vai, vaio, or vii.
The second argument is the verb stem, which must be given in double vowel orthography. N mutating verbs (like miizh, omiinaa) must be spelled with a final capital N. S mutating verbs (like nishi, onisaa) must be spelled with a final capital S. Verbs ending in an i must be spelled without it (mami > mam). Verbs with a final o must be spelled with a final w instead (amo > amw).
